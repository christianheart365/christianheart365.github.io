                        </a>
						<p>
						My personal opinion is that after you are a Christian, it may be best to focus on getting over addiction's of the "Ego-Devil-Mind" through prayer, fasting and abstaining from stimulating media content or alike. And, do this continually for the rest of your life, not letting any evil thoughts, imaginings or feelings control you. You are to be in control. This is known as "Ego-Death". If doing this, avoid meditation's which stimulate "Chakra's / third eye / kundalini" and only stick to practicing the control of keeping a peaceful thought free mind. Still, quiet, and stress free, always. This "Ego-Mind" is mostly as far as I can tell in my experience, the cause of most of my suffering in life. It tells me "I must have this", "I hate that", "I cannot do this", or "it's your fault". It hardly ever stays quiet and makes people think their thoughts and feelings are them. It is like someone else talking for you, doing for you, living for you, most often leading you to an early addicted bitter angry selfish fearful death with no friends or family. It is a menace if not controlled. Learn to control it, whilst, being a Christian first. God can help with the addiction's and more (2 Corinthians 10:5 KJV), (Luke 17:20-21 KJV).
						</p>
						<p>
						If you read a bible, please first focus on understanding what the Gospel is about, and how to be saved. This is mostly covered in a Gospel of either Matthew, Mark Luke or John in the New Testament the last quarter of a bible. Then proceed to the Book of Acts, and the Letters in the same section. These are what Christianity is focused on mostly, the arriving of Jesus the Christ, the only begotten son of God.

	<!--  ------------ Section 2 - Doctrine ---------  -->
            <section id="section2">
                <div class="content">
                    <div class="text">
                        <h2>Section 2 - Doctrinal Basics of the Gospel Message </h2>
                        <p class="tall">
						<span class="boldSpan">HERE IS THE GOSPEL</span>
						. This message can be summarized by four things God wants you to Know.
						<span class="boldSpan">(1) You need to be saved from the punishement of the wicked things you have done in your life</span>
						. In the epistle to the Romans, the Apostle Paul concludes his first 3 chapters with the statement that:
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“All have sinned and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3v23).
						</span>
						Not one of us can keep all the commandments of God. The prophet Isaiah likens us to sheep: 
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way” (Isaiah 53v6).
						</span>
						</p>
						
						<p class="tall">
						Sin has its consequences for God will bring us into judgement one day:
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgement” (Hebrews 9v27)
						</span>
						Since the statistics show that 10 out of 10 people die, we ought to be concerned about our soul’s eternal destiny:
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20v15). 
						</span>
						Is your name in this book?
						</p>
						
						<p class="tall">
						<span class="boldSpan">(2) You cannot save yourself.</span>
						The Apostle Paul explains to the Ephesians that:
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“<span class="small-superscript">(8)</span>By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: <span class="small-superscript">(9)</span>Not of works, lest any man should boast” (Ephesians 2v8-9).</span>
						It’s no good trying your best to keep the law of God:
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“a man is not justified by the works of the law” (Galatians 2v16).
						</span>
						There is only one way to be saved. 
						<span class="boldSpan">Jesus said:</span>
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me” (John 14v6)
						</span>
						. <span class="boldSpan">(3) God has provided for your salvation</span>
						. The Apostle John explains the love of God to us in the famous verse:
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him, shall not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3v16).
						</span>
						God can forgive us because He punished His own Son for our sins:
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15v3), 
						“the LORD hath laid on Him the inquity of us all” (Isaiah 53v6).
						</span>
						</p>

						<p class="tall">	
						 The Apostle Peter tells us:
						 <span class="italicSpan">
						“Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God” (1 Peter 3v18)
						</span>
						. The Lord Jesus is able to save and keep you.
						Jesus is able to save you because God raised Him from the dead:
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justification” (Romans 4v25). 
						</span>
						The writer to the Hebrews goes further when he says:
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them” (Hebrews 7v25).
						</span>
						The Apostle Paul who was religious before he became a Christian speaks of the reason why Jesus came into our world:
						<span class="italicSpan">
						“Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief” (1 Timothy 1v15). 
						</span> Paul stating he is a sinner, because before being a christian believer in Jesus, he persecuted the followers of Jesus the Christ (annointed), having them jailed and sentenced to death.
						</p>
						
						<p class="tall">
							<span class="boldSpan">(4) Religion cannot save you, only Christ can.</span>
							You may ask the question, how then can I be saved? God gives us two conditions to receive His free salvation:
							<span class="boldSpan">Repentance towards God. </span>
							<span class="italicSpan">
							“God..now commandeth all men everywhere to repent” (Acts 17v30)
							“except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish” (Luke 13v3,5)
							“repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out” (Acts 3v19)
							</span>
							, and, 
							<span class="boldSpan">faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, </span>						
							<span class="italicSpan">
							“Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved” (Acts 16v31)
							“the same Lord is rich unto all that call upon Him, for whosever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” (Romans 10v12,13).
							</span>
							Repentance involves 3 things (1) a complete change of mind about sin, (2) a true sorrow for your past sins and (3) a genuine desire for a complete change of life. Faith in Christ involves depending upon Him forever. This includes His person and His work on the cross for you. If you truly repent and trust Christ as your saviour, you will be saved and will have done all that God asks of you, so that you can be sure that you have eternal life.
							<span class="italicSpan">
							“He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life” (John 3v36).
							</span>

						</p>
						<p class="tall">
						<span class="boldSpan">WATER - BAPTISM -</span> itself does not save; rather, it is an outward sign of an inward change and a pledge of a good conscience toward God. It symbolizes the believer's identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Salvation is by faith alone in Jesus Christ, and baptism follows as an act of obedience and public declaration of that faith. (1 Peter 3:21, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 6:3-4)
						</p>
						<p class="tall">
						<span class="boldSpan">COMMUNION & FELLOWSHIP -</span>
						The breaking of bread and fellowship are essential practices for believers, symbolizing unity, remembrance of Christ's sacrifice, and mutual encouragement. Christians are encouraged to gather regularly, not forsaking the assembly of the saints, to worship, pray, share in communion, and strengthen one another's faith. This gathering fosters spiritual growth and maintains the sense of community within the body of Christ. (Acts 2:42, Hebrews 10:24-25). Communion is also a declaration to all other's that you are a Christian who believe's and follows Jesus Christ.
						</p>
						<p class="tall">
						Believers are encouraged to diligently study the Scriptures to show themselves approved by God, rightly dividing the word of truth. Christians are to pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances, and live in a manner worthy of the calling they have received. They are also called to love one another, bear each other's burdens, and serve with humility and compassion. (2 Timothy 2:15, 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18, Ephesians 4:1-3, Galatians 6:2, John 13:34-35).

						<span id="underline-highlight" class="boldSpan">DOCTRINE - BEHAVIOUR</span>
						</p>
						<p>
						  <span class="boldSpan">JESUS - GREAT - COMMISION</span> - 						
						<span class="italicSpan">“<span class="small-superscript">(19)</span>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<span class="small-superscript">(20)</span> Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.” (Matthew 28:19-20).</span> The model of making people into church leaders and evangelists and teachers is to make NEW disciples from the nations of the world, and not to solely rely on your children to carry on running the current church or "system in use". How do you know if they will even stay as a church follower when they are older? Relying on this is to allow the whole church to collapse because either one persons son died, or became an athiest, or was to ill to do the work, or moved to another country to do outreach somewhere else, or simply became an average christian who did not feel fit to run a church or "ministry".
						</p>
						<p>
						Therefore, yes train your children, but firstly, GO - FORTH - AND - MAKE - DISCIPLES, who in turn will make more disciples, and then there is no risk of a collapsing church. There is no such thing as retirement for a christian in regards to the Gospel and work of Jesus Christ. If a person is too weak to do it alone, Apostles went out in two's. Other religions although false, put christians to shame due to the amount of evangelism they do. E,G, Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormon's (Church of LDS) come to mind. And do not give no "help" or guidance by not having a full gospel on a tract or at least having links to it on the tract leaflets. Send them to another persons  church or website if you have no resources to give them. At least give them some useful materials and not simply leave them and go to another town, allowing the Devil, Satan, Lucifer, to snatch away the message from them whilst you think you have saved someone, and have ultimately, not. Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves; not ignorant in one and average in the other. What use is a person who leaves a baby in the wilderness with "belive in Jesus and you shall be saved"? Do they know what sin is, or who Jesus is, or why they need Him, or how to live afterwards to not be chastised? How did you help them? Therefore, MAKE disciples.
						</p>
						</p>
						 <span class="boldSpan">SUNDAY - SCHOOL</span> - Many adults remember going to "Sunday School" and want to never return again due to the way it was done. It often as has been the case, been a dulled-down baby version of education not serious in any area due to the teachers and organisers thinking it is "too much and innapropriate" to teach children "serious bible things". This is an error which leads people to not become Christian and abandon the church forever. The boredom and lack of purposeful effort in teaching "adult christianity" may have sent many people to HELL through well meaning yet too soft a "Sunday School" teacher or organiser. In secular school you allow them to learn math, science, and much more. Yet you who are to teach them the most important things, draw pictures and give sweeties to those who think them a "boring dull drag"; only remaining at church because their parients sent them, or forced them. Don't get me wrong, drawing and games are fine in moderation if biblical, but to do this mostly, and then send people home, is to send them to HELL, if they do not become DISCIPLES of Jesus Christ. What did you actually teach them? That church is dull and with no information other than a song, a cup of squash, tea, or a sweet treat for saying a verse? You can do this, but teach the serious things too. Even if you "feel" it is not appropriate, because it makes YOU "feel" awkward. Get a backbone and do not keep sending people to HELL. You have been warned.
						<p>
						<p>
						<span class="boldSpan">MARRIAGE & SEXUALITY -</span> 
						  The Bible defines marriage as a covenant between one man and one woman, intended to last until death. The marriage covenant ends at the death of a spouse, freeing a widower or widow to remarry. There is no biblical restriction on a widow remarrying based on whether she has children.
						</p>
						<p>
						 The New Testament teaches that a person may not divorce their spouse, with two specific exceptions in which the innocent party is released from the marriage covenant and may remarry:

							Sexual Immorality (Porneia): Jesus gives this as the sole exception to the prohibition on divorce (Matthew 19:9). This word is a broad term for any illicit sexual act that violates the marriage covenant.

							Malicious Desertion: The Apostle Paul teaches that if an unbelieving spouse abandons a Christian spouse, the believer is "not under bondage". This is not an excuse to become divorced but allows for separation. Reconcilliation is what God desires. Therefore choose your marriage partner wisely and work hard to keep your marriage (1 Corinthians 7:15).
						</p>
						<p>
						 If a person divorces for any reason other than fornication, the original marriage covenant is still considered binding by God, and remarrying is considered adultery.
						</p>
						<p>
						 <span class="boldSpan">Separation and Reconciliation -</span> 

							The Bible does allow for separation in some cases, but strongly encourages reconciliation. If a Christian couple separates, they are advised to either remain married and single, or be reconciled to their spouse (1 Corinthians 7:10-11).
						</p>
						<p>
						 <span class="boldSpan">Other Relationships -</span> 

							All sexual activity is reserved for a marriage covenant between one man and one woman. The Bible considers all other forms of sexual relationships to be outside of God's design (Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Leviticus 18:22). The Old Testament law also states that if a divorced woman remarries, her first husband is not permitted to take her back as his wife, even if her second husband dies or divorces her (Deuteronomy 24:4).
						</p>
						<p>
						  It is scientifically proven that women retain their male partners' DNA for years after their last sexual encounter. This aligns with the Bible's statement that men and women become "one flesh" through sexual union and shouldnot be treated as a small matter little importance as many treat it. (1 Corinthians 6:16)
						</p>
						<p>
						  <span class="boldSpan">CHILDREN</span> - Children are to obey their parents in godly matters. Parents should guide, correct, and educate their children with love and patience. (Proverbs 13:24, Ephesians 6:1-4)

						  Teach children the ways of God from a young age, and they will not stray from them when they grow older. Encourage them to seek God in all things and to become wise, not easily misled. (Proverbs 22:6)
						</p>
						<p>
						  <span class="italicSpan">"He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes."</span> (Proverbs 13:24). This means to correct your children, not to beat them. Educate and explain to them the reasons for correction. Poor parenting can lead to a cycle of ignorance and suffering.
						</p>
						<p>
						 <span class="boldSpan">BISHOP'S / ELDER'S / DEACON'S -</span> must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to wine, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, and not a lover of money. They must manage their own family well and see that their children obey them. Although they run the church activity, they are not more important than any other believer (see 1 Timothy 3:1-7, Titus 1:6-9). How can a person run a church if they do not know how to run a family (this is the general principal).
						</p>
						
						<p>
						 <span class="boldSpan">CHURCH - DUTIES -</span> The church of believer's (not a building) is to look after the church believer's and the Gospel outreach ministry first. To look after and visit the homeless, the elderly, the widows, the orphans, and to make disciples of all nations. But the church is not to look after all widows and the previously mentioned. Those of the church come first. It the church is broken and poor and homeless, help these first, and other's second or as God leads you to do for other's. Discipleship is for all nations, meaning, make students of all nations in the word and work of the word of God as the bible states (Matthew 28:19)
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Start by prioritizing fellow believers: Galatians 6:10 emphasizes caring "especially unto them who are of the household of faith," meaning Christians are called to look after one another first (visiting and helping the widows, the sick, fatherless, homeless etc).</li>
							<li>Extend kindness universally: Matthew 5:44 reminds believers to love your enemies and bless them that curse or persecute or despitefully use you. This showcasing that acts of love and kindness should go beyond faith boundaries.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
						<span class="boldSpan">SPIRITUAL - GIFT'S -</span> are given by the Holy Spirit for the benefit of the church. Not all believers receive the same gifts. Some may have the gift of prophecy, healing, teaching, speaking in tongues, evangelism or performing miracles. Others may be gifted with wisdom, knowledge, faith, discernment, management, or something else as God see’s fit (1 Corinthians 12:4-11, Romans 12:6-8, Ephesians 4:11-13) 
						</p>
						<p>
						<span class="boldSpan">WOMEN - IN - CHURCH -</span><span class="italicSpan">"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."</span> (1 Timothy 2:11-12 KJV). <span class="italicSpan">"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law."</span> (1 Corinthians 14:34 KJV). <span class="italicSpan">"For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."</span> (1 Timothy 2:13-14 KJV). <span class="italicSpan">"But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered."</span> (1 Corinthians 11:5-6 KJV). <span class="italicSpan">"For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels."</span> (1 Corinthians 11:10 KJV).
						</p>
						<p>
							Proverbs also says that a woman's ways are the destruction of King's. Therefore, if we as Christians are a holy nation of priests as the bible describes (1 Peter 2:9), we are then if under control of a woman, such as a Bishop, Elder, Deacon, Pastor or Priest, we are in essence destroying the kingdom of Christian's (Proverbs 31:3). We are essentially allowing women to destroy the "Church" or the "Nation of Holy Priests", or at least cursing it in some way, correct? (Isaiah 3:12).
						</p>	
						<p>
						It is not clear to many why women are to remain silent in church and cover their heads when praying or prophesying, but it is mentioned "because of the angels". Either because angels recognise ordered authority structure, or something else. I do not know, but the church I go to, women wear hats because of this. It is awkward to have so much silence from women but that is the way it is. Other churches choose to say a womans hair is her "covering". It does not seem accurate though. This is why nun's or similar wear head coverings nearly always.
						</p>
						<p>
						<span class="boldSpan">FAITH & TRUST - IN - GOD'S - PLAN: -</span> Encourage others to maintain faith and trust in God's plan, even during challenging times. It's natural to feel abandoned or doubt, but God is always present, working behind the scenes for our good (Hebrews 13:5, Romans 8:28). Remember, God is not your slave, you are His servant and should work accordingly even if there is no sign of help from God. Do your duty (but I do understand sometimes it does seem pointless to continue; ignore feelings generally because feelings can be deceptive, therefore keep going).
						</p>
						<p>
						<span class="boldSpan">PRAYER -</span> It is not desireable for any to discourage people from or to restrict people from opportunities of prayer unless it interferes with more important Christian ministry activities. To not pray and ask for help on the Lord's Day (Sunday service) is to not follow the teachings of the bible and Jesus Christ. Some do not pray and say it is not appropriate during morning service, and yet often this involves giving thanks only. But the bible says:
						<span class="italicSpan">“<span class="small-superscript">(16)</span>Rejoice evermore.<span class="small-superscript">(17)</span>Pray without ceasing.” <span class="small-superscript">(18)</span>In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you." (1 Thessalonians 5:16–18).</span> People who restrict prayer in church out of reverence for the moment saying we should not pray in the morning service, reduce the opportunity for people to pray together when they gather and therefore restrict the growth, protection, blessings and more, towards those who pray and are prayed for.
						</p>
						<p>
						Because, Jesus said, <span class="italicSpan">“<span class="small-superscript">(19)</span>Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.<span class="small-superscript">(20)</span>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them." (Matthew 18:19-20).</span> Notice it says "2 or 3", and not "1". And saying in a service, "lets pray" and then only thanks is given, is this not a little lie every time it is said with no intention to pray? The temple of God was called the "House of Prayer" not the "House of Thanksgiving". Pray especially when more than one of you is present, and also when alone; always. Make prayer purposeful and not a flippent light on the spur of the moment weak infrequent thing. Write them down to order them and not waste words or time. Gather them for a session of prayer regularly as to not become "luc-warm" in prayer, or, out of practice and empty headed on what to pray. This can happen if effort is not made. Who are you praying for, why, where, when, and more, should be thought of in order to have an effective prayer of purpose and not simply "Lord please bless us on our way home, and the ministry gospel message tonight". Although this is nice, it does little for anyone else. Think, about prayer.

						<span id="underline-highlight" class="boldSpan">PRE-DESTINATION</span>
						</p>
						<P>
							This is the concept of God arranging things before they happen for a specific reason and plan that God has decided to lay out for all time. Meaning, God has planned for all who believe in Jesus the Christ (annointed), that they WIL be confromed to the image of His Son Jesus the Christ. Either in this life (if it is even possible) or at the resurrection of the dead when all believer's in Jesus Christ are given new "Glorified" bodies like unto angels. But we do not know what this. Calvinist's believe a further addition of pre-destination. That God has chosen all the people who will be saved and they have no power to choose but are given "un-resistable Grace and Faith" so they will have no choice but to follow and believe in Jesus Christ because if it was left to the person to choose, Calvinism says we cannot choose because we are entirely corrupted with an opposing will to godly things. We cannot choose of our own free-will to follow and BELIEVE the true gospel message of Jesus being our saviour from Hell and the "lake of fire". We cannot turn to God away from our sin of our own free-will. This is what Calvinism generally believe's.
							<p>
							</p>
							 I do not follow this doctrine and merely think it is that God has made the world, and if you think of it like a board game or a computer role play game, you have choices to be good or bad; but what you can do is limited to the laws of the world you live in. You do not have free-will to fly like a bird, but you can move in a direction. You can choose to hurt or help others. And only in my limited opinion, you can choose to turn to God and believe the Gospel message if someone preaches it to you or you receive it another way. After that point, only in my opinion, you are pre-destined to be conformed, as all believer's are, to the image of Jesus Christ; and pre-destined to be saved from the wrath of God. You choose to enter the shelter from destruction, or you choose to stay out of the protection of Jesus Christ and his blood covering of your sins. Calvinism in my opinion makes people less worried about trying to evangelise and save others by saying to themselves, "well God has already decided, so I can't change anything". If they are right then nothing bad happens, but if they are wrong, millions more people go to Hell and the "Lake of fire" for all eternity because of their academic scholarly philosophy that is in error.
						</P>

						<p>
						<span id="underline-highlight" class="boldSpan">EATING / WORKING / FASTING</span>
						</p>
						 <span class="italicSpan">"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat." (Thessalonians 3:10).</span>
						This signifies a person unwilling to work should not eat. But this does not include someone who cannot work. People are often lazy or idle or exscuse makers and should not be encouraged or allowed to do so if it can be helped.
						</p>
						<p>
						- Potentially only in <span class="boldSpan">my opinion</span> a person should not eat most foods if they do not work. Meaning, eating, especially carbohydrates / sugars / fruits / breads / potatoes / carrots / swede / and alike, fill up the liver with stored Glycogen (sugar) for when the body fasts during sleep. But, if you do not work, only a tiny amount of carbohydrates are required. Any more than 40grams (a guess) of carbohydrates per day would stack up for multiple days if you consume fats and proteins also. You will not empty the liver and will therefore likely become type 2 diabetic until you keep the liver low or empty of sugar stores. Is this why the bible says Jesus followers "will fast" (Matthew 9:15) when he is not present? To stop us from becoming ill when we are inactive doing little or nothing for days or weeks at a time? Who knows, only mentioning it for health potentials. Always consult a doctor and do your own research before fasting or changing diets.

                        <p>
						The christian holy bible is comprised of 66 small books in one volume called a "bible". There seems to be only one current bible translation that God has proven to be supported even if many scholars do not see or look at the evidence and disbelieve it. Much computer analysis has been done and shown in obvious proof video and chart content which is undeniable unless one wants to lie to oneself and others (intentionally or not). To ignore the evidence, is to say that someone or something other than God, time travelled, manipulated all people's minds, all historical events, all texts, whilst being invisible and controlling all of this, and knowing the beginning of all things and the end of all things, all without being God. And remember, there were no verse numbers or chapters until at least 1000+ years after the crucifixion of Jesus, and, they were created before the King James Bible.
						</p>
						<p>
						The information in the list given below, shows only a few of the proofs that God has certified his word, through time.  Not only in the past, but the present and future, as God knows all things. Many more proofs can be found in the links and website information provided. The basis of proof is on the numbers mainly 7's and 666's and counts in total for each, and also verses. 7 is often used by God and Jesus for some form of perfection and 666's are some for of evil or bad occurence. The bible is written by men inspired by the "Holy Spirit" (also being of the one God).

						Remember, people who use other bible's are often fully Christian also. They are often simply not aware of the issue due to other persons who study Greek and Hebrew thinking they know best telling them the King James Bible is not a great translation or is less than the best "modern versions" with "older manuscripts" (Sinaiticus / Vaticainus etc). There is not need to push people into something they are not ready for by causing division and argument. If they are ready to hear it they will listen. If they are not, they will resist.

						The next list of links are associated with the ancient text translations used in the bibles themselves, covering their reliability as being fake or real. The Greek and Hebrew only have use if you use the correct text sources. Generally you are likely to discover that any modern bible that is not of the King James textual line that you find today in shops and online, is based on fake or forged texts, or at least texts that the majority of ancient texts and pieces found, do not support. The modern discoveries on the whole, support the King James bible and not the "new versions". These bible's do not say the same thing as the KJV and corrupt the word of God.

						Please remember I started out reading the NIV, and went on to buy and read many other bible versions which I now no longer own due to the personal disgust and feeling I have at attempting to buy or read a "fake bible". But I do not hate anyone or put anyone down for using them. But, it is best to get a King James Bible as soon as you can in order to not fall into docrines of error and evil traditions that are not christian. It's up to you and God in the end, not me. Do the best you can, and that is all you can do (pray, if you cannot find one). Otherwise, if you cannot understand english, find a version of bible based on your language that is translated from the King James Bible, ideally. if this is not possible, do your best with what you have and continue to seek the best you can get (prayer can help).

An audio bible is available online also but the KJV is copyright protected in the United Kingdom. Only in other nations do they have freedom to use it as much as they want. The UK is limited use due to "Crown Copyright".

They are a religious order of secret handshakes and satanic evil practices. You cannot prove the video images of Donald Trump and Elon Musk are fake because Donald Trump did make a USSF (United States Space Force) and Elon Musk has had on his (twitter) "X" social media profile image, him wearing red anti-christian Freemason Baphomet upside down Christian cross armour. It is real. but in regards to Donald Trump and the symbols of the " US Space Force" it is difficult at present to be certain due to the likeliness of him actually choosing the hat symbols and other associated symbology and not some other Freemason.

							Many movies, television shows and music videos as well as computer
							games and animations often show openly freemasonic symbols and
							narratives. Such as: Star Wars Syth & Jedi with "lightsabers, lightning
							bearers" and "ray" as a character. Lucifer, Satan, the devil, is known as
							the "light­bearer". Also, Superman the "sunlight & eye beam bearer".
							"Shazam", also called "Captain Marvel", "Black Adam", and "The
							Flash", all bear lightning symbols just like "Harry Potter", on their
							costumes, and Harry as a mark on his forehead. The "Deathly Hallows" Harry Potter symbol is also admittedly based on freemasonry.
						</p>
							
						<p>
							Other films and series include "Naruto Shippuden -­ the 666 sharingan eyes", "Star Trek ­- all
							seeing eye tower", "Lord of the Rings -­ all seeing eye tower of torch
							fire". "Marvel Avengers -­ Iron man bearing light beams and the "glove
							of light", and Thor ­ has lightning and a two 'horn' winged crown", as
							does the singer "Madonna" on her album covers who also wears the
							pyramid and all seeing eye on other album artwork and clothing.
						</p>

						<p class="tall">
							The whole premise of Naruto Shippuden (Anime) and the Sharingan is
							a Ninja war of magic spell casting and death. To gain the "soul stone" in
							"Marvel Avengers Infinity War" you have to also kill what you love most
							to gain power like an Uchia Sharingan. Sharingan eyes are gained by killing a loved one or doing evil actions.
							Doing more evil gets more powerful eyes. The "eye tower" used in the
							"Tsukuyomi Genjutsu", is extremely similar to the "Lord of The Rings"
							film series and the Star­Trek "Origin" advert (cube tower with eye­pool).
						</p>
						
						<p class="tall-up">
							You may not belive it but many of the main movies, film-series and cartoons for kids often have the bad guy as Jesus and the good guy as the devil. This so called bad guy (Lord Vegeta - Dragonball-Z, Lord Darth Vadar - Star Wars, Lord Megatron - Transformers, Lord Voldermort - Harry Potter, Apocalypse as God or Jesus in Superman and more. The so called good guy is nearly always in blue and red (scarlett and purple). They even state they are rebels in some form or another. The autobots, the Jedi / Rebellion, the Half-bloods like fallen angels as wizards in harry potter against the pure bloods. The devil 666 eyed Uchia Clan defeating the creator of the world. The list goes on. This is international in every language. Therefore it is not coincidence.

							Other religions like "Scientology", "Mormonism", the "Church of Satan",

							a Freemason and has 3 of the Freemason ceremonies. The "Church of
							Satan" has as far as I am aware, all of the same ceremonies as
							Freemasonry. Catholicism, also has "The Knights Templars" which are a parallel offshoot of Freemasonry 
							which the Pope visits / has visited in Israel because Freemasonry was banned for Catholics previously so they do not use

						World organisations, the Royal Family in the United Kingdom, many leaders of many nations and there positions of power like education, healthcare, military, policing, banking and more, are largely directed or controlled towards the "Freemason's will". This is quite obvious because they are blatant with the symbology in all area's they control and participate in. This is why the world is so crazy and disordered in our time of 2025. Most of it is planned, in my and millions of other's opinion bassed on the evidence. The "Freemason's direction" is treason to the population of the nation as it works against other's for it's own gain with secret handshakes and hidden favours all to further the control of Freemasonry over the whole world. they tell you this openly but not in person, only in media content, symbols, movies and books etc. They destroy the world. Some may do and hope to do good, because they are low level ignorant follower. This is because it is a tier based level system.

							The short story of "Agenda 21" (30 etc), is it is an initiated plan of various sorts, organised by the "Deep State", the "Shadow Elite World Kabal", the "Hidden Overlords" of the places of power such as governments, banks, education, media, healthcare and more. It is in many persons opinion linked to the United Nations (NATO), the "World Economic Forumn" (WEF), the "Royal Families", and in particular FREEMASONRY. They meet in secret places underneath airports, or in the Bohemian Grove, or other places less well known and unknown. This is what people who are called "conspiracy theorists" have said. Yet, in "NATO" the documents exist and are freely available in various places called "Agenda 21". The plan to reduce the population of the world to 500 million people, to have one international government, and all nations at a level equal to each other in regards to wealth and freedom of trade. This all would obviously require the current western more "wealthy" nations to become poorer in order to raise up the "poorer" ones. Covid-19 virus is said to be a planned operation because the virus "spike-protein" was patented around 2016 (see previous 4 videos), potentially used to push new laws and controlling changes onto the masses of the world and remove many freedoms we may have had.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is what people believe is happening in regards to the removal of borders by officials pretending to stop mass migration, when it keeps happening even when governments promise to lower it. Also, the "WOKE" irrational ultra-liberal behaviours, the re-education of children against parents sensible will, the shadow banning of books that are "normal and conservative" as well as other media online or offline (tv / radio), transvestites / drag-queens reading to children in libraries causing confusion, men in womens sports or bathrooms and much more. This is because they have a unified goal of "Agenda 21" in many persons opinions. Take all this as you will. But the mark of the beast may come from this (not being able to buy or sell without accepting it or bowing down to "it" etc - see bible book - Revelation.

							<span class="boldSpan">
							CATHOLICISM ­& GREEK-ORTHODOX (orthodox)- Catholicsm ignores the bible and puts the Pope above ALL -
							</span>
							They add traditions to Christianity that are burdensome when Jesus complained about traditions in the Judaism in the Old Testament "adding" or "taking away" what they should not. Catholicism has much anti­-christian practice of talking to the dead / familiar
							spirits of "living in heaven" saints. It installs extra mediators between God and man; 
							<span class="italicSpan">"For
							there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;" (1 Timothy 2:5).</span>
							It also supports prayer to the saints who died and are in heaven, asking them to make petitions for ("you") the one making prayer because the bible points out the prayers of a fervent holy person are more effective than a less holy person. By this a perfected saint in heaven has the strongest prayers. But, Jesus said to his apostles directly when on the earth, that they are not to ask Jesus to pray to God the Father for them, but they should pray directly to God the Father and that anything they ask the Father in Jesus name, He (Jesus) will do it, because they loved Jesus, and God the Father loves them. How then can I pray to Mary the Mother of Jesus or an apostle, asking them to pray for me and intercede so my prayers are answered. This is at odds with the direction of Jesus even to the Apostle's; and is anti-christian teaching yes?
							<br>
							<span class="boldSpan">(John 16:26-27)</span>.
						</p>
						<p>
							But, be aware, many Catholic's are true christian believer's and are saved. But, this does not condone the actions against christianity. Many believe in Jesus as Lord and Saviour, either in full understanding or in part. This obviously depends on what they are taught and / or study. They also have a different bible with the "Apocrypha" (extra books) that the King James does not. The same is true for the Greek Orthodox Church in regards to adding traditions and extra books that are not in the KJV. If they believe they have to "pay off their own sins", then this is not christian but "works based salavation". Jesus paid it ALL.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="italicSpan"><span class="small-superscript">(8)</span> "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<span class="small-superscript"> (9)</span> Not of works, lest any man should boast."</span> (Ephesians 2:8-9). Even "Clement" one of the first "church father's" wrote the same, and further said, works are for the Glory of God. They are not for Salvation. But, a good follower of Christ will do good works from the heart and not by dictation and trying to "get salvation by works". There is a big difference. Others will say the "traditions teach otherwise", and there lies the issue. Jesus quoted the Old Testament and not the Judaic Rabbi's Talmudic Traditions. The Apostles quoted the same, and eachother. The "Church Father's" or Bishop's and Pope's are not in the bible. So why follow their "church history" and not the bible? Was it not good enough for the followers of Jesus? Help in understanding is one thing, but adding anti-christian practices is another.

						<p>
							<span class="boldSpan">
							JUDAISM (without Jesus) ­- requires Jesus.
							</span>
							It is correct until it denies
							Jesus as the Messiah which it's own "Old Testament" texts prove Jesus
							to be: 
							<span class="italicSpan">"And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
							inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and
							they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn
							for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for
							him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn."</span> (Zechariah 12:10), plus (Isaiah 50:6­7) and (Isaiah 53:5­6).
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="italicSpan">"<span class="small-superscript">(16)</span>...they pierced my hands and my
							feet. <span class="small-superscript">(17)</span>  I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. <span class="small-superscript">(18)</span> They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture."</span>
							(Psalm 22:16­-18). Jesus is shown in a foreshadowing or is prophesied through the bible.
						</p>
						<p>
							The main issue that leads Judaism into error with regards to knowing Jesus as the Messiah, the Saviour, the Annointed, the Christ, is that use a large set of books like many other religions to decide what the text of the Torah (the 5 Law books of Moses) and the books of the prophets also. These books are like an encyclopaedia of Rabbi teachers and their opinions on the text which is what governs what is accepted mainstream Judaism doctrine. Religious Jews are taught to believe what the Babylonian Talmud books say, rather than what the text directly says. They put most if not all the bible words as allegory with some sort of lesson to be learned rather than reading what it says. This may not be the case for all, but it is for most as far as I am aware. These Rabbi teachings did not exist in Moses day so it is illogical to think God expected people to understand by figuring out allegorical riddles for a thousand plus years in order to understand the text and it's meaning. Is this not illogical to do? Is it not logical to simply read and ask God for help to understand? The bible says that people will no longer need a teacher as the laws of God will be written in people's hearts. So how does the Talmud fit in with that. It does not, right?

						<p>
							<span class="boldSpan">
							BLACK-HEBREW-ISRAELITES (or Prophet/ess, followers) = nonsense.
							</span>
							The prophets and law were until John the baptist (Matthew 11:13). Gentiles
							(non­Jews) saved (Acts 10:45). Cursed Jews / Israelites (Roman 9:3). This group is basically the opposite mirror of hitler in that they basically make it seem God hates white people and the black people are the true Israelite Hebrew people. And that Jesus Christ will detroy all white people or make them slaves on his return. But God says to not oppress foreigners (Exodus 23:9).
						</p>
						<p>
							Slavery in the bible changes evil people into followers of God or eventually they die of old age as violent sick twisted slaves from Pagan nations that kill children whilst sacrificing them, or having sex with animals and / or their own relatives of any sort. This is why as far as Christian's can tell, God put a limit on slavery duration for a person who follows God the Father, the God of the bible (LORD) in the Old Testament, of six years; then they are to be treated as one of the people of Israel, no matter their colour or crede (see Exodus 12:48 and Exodus 21:1-6). This is only what seems biblical as far as I know (research yourself and ask God for answers also).

							The issue is with these groups, all of them, is they rely on external
							support to live daily life. They do not have jobs if they follow the belief
							fully. They receive food, land and more from donations in most cases,
							and build there temples and idols from these funds. This is pure
							selfishness and lazyness at the expense of others hoping to be blessed
							and not cursed, through helping "holy ones" of these religious factions.
							In the end they do believe we are all a part of one God, one, in a dream
							of God, who is having experiences in different forms at the will of God,
							even the misery of all things. A sadistic sick minded God who pretends
							to not know what God is. Praying to itself for help in a mess of fake
							religions and more. This is a lunacy of false belief, or a lunatic god of
							nonsense. Yes? Who would want to be a part of this sort of "god".
						</p>
						<p>
							Re-incarnation religions of any sort for the most part, also leave an issue of "eternal unforgiven debt". This means if the person "Joe Bloggs" in a human body, dies, and holds everyone guilty of ruining his life, a debt of "Joe Bloggs" is held against everyone who will ever live forever, with no chance of paying off this debt, because "Joe Bloggs" died. If "Joe Bloggs" lived again in another re-incarnate state, this would not matter due to a new name, identity, a new person being born who could not forgive for the life of another person who is not this new person born, called "Mary Smith". Therefore eternal debt remains forever against all beings who hold others responsible and have been wronged by others. This never ends and becomes an ever increasing debt because the past debt holds even new birthed persons accountable even though "Joe Bloggs" has not lived for a million years. Utter nonsense. There is no hope in such a religious belief.
						</p>
						<p>
							The other idea persons of the re-incarnate religions put forward is the thought that we are all "one with God in the dream of God", and that when we become enlightened in some unknown way other than to realise this "fact" as they say it is, "we can eventually re-dream the dream, as we are a part of God". This big problem this causes is that when one is of a monastic monk like or yogi like mind, there is no desire to want anything. Therefore there is not a will to "re-dream" anything; causing a person who is enlightened, to end up exactly where they left off; being re-born into the normal misery of human and animal life and death with pain and suffering. Or go up and down like a yoyo into higher ascended plains of divine ability, only to sink down again to the lows of a devil. utter nonsense unless God is bored and a lunatic who indulges in self-harm.

These are false teacher's of false doctrines of "health and wealth", or worldly gain for this fleshly human body here and now and not for the kingdom which we seek that is not an earthly kingdom but a heavenly one. Jesus kingdom is not of this earth, not of this world. Therefore working, praying and lusting after worldly things is not-christian. We are told to be content with what we have, and, to seek first the kingdom of God. If we seek wealth and prosperity it is to be for another's wealth and prosperity, not our own.

They are often very famous leading millions of people astray into christian filled error. Many people who believe these televangelist preacher's are unlikely to be christian due to believing false things in regards to salvation and Jesus the Christ the Son of God (Him being God also).

                        <h2>Sacrifice & Efforts</h2>
						
						<p>
						The biblical model of a Christian life is selflessness and servitude to God and other's before choosing oneself. This is a difficult thing to do because what do we even do for anyone. There is the obvious of feed the poor, heal and help the sick, visit widows and orphans and so forth. Be kind generous and in control of your beviour whilst resisting all temptations and repenting (turning from) the things you know you should not do (sinning) either in a small or large way. This is the biblical model. Then there is prayer every day, at any time. Then, fasting because Jesus said himself when he was present his followers do not fast whilst the "bridegrooom" (Jesus) is present, but afterwards when he leaves they WILL fast. The Catholics choose Wednesdays and Thursdays as well as the 40 days of lent representing Jesus fasting in the wilderness. Although most eat limited plain food at this time rather than fully fast from all food and drink. The Jewish days are as I recall Tuesdays and Thursdays. But, always consult a doctor if you intend to do a fast, and do some research as it can be dangerous if done poorly or by people who should not do it due to health conditions.
						</p>
						<p>						
						As mentioned, Jesus said we "WILL" fast (for our own good, not to be mean). It kills desire and cravings that enslave us as well as purifies the body of some or all toxins, shrinks loose skin, and reduces bodily fat, and more. Full fasts are often done by Christians for one or two days per week or for longer if one wills to cleanse and purify or get closer to God "more", by lessening the "sinful fleshly barriers" that hinder us from doing so most of the time. What you do is between you and God. Many people do not fast but this is to their harm and likely the shortening of their lives in the long-term (see - Matthew 9:15).
						</p>
						<p>
						The book of "Proverbs" in the Old Testament is a group of helpful lessons when examined, which guide a person away from evil, misfortune, punishment or chastisement from God, loss of wealth and reputation as well as health, and more. There are many guidances which show the restrictions a person must put upon themselves by their own actions and choices, in order to live a prosperous happy life of Godly living, but not necessarily a rich one. The bible points out the love of money is the route of all evil. So, wealth is not to be desired for oneself, but if you have it, use it well for God without being foolish and wasteful. Many persons have rushed into giving all they have only to have little or no effect on saving or helping others in the long-term. This is not to say hold back money or wealth, but to be sensible. Don't throw your money at an alcoholic or a drug addict (better to buy them food, clothing, or more useful things like support). Otherwise you might actually kill them in one day.
						</p>
						<p>
						Some texts from the "Puritan Christian's" had a thing where they would keep eachother on the path of Godliness by asking one another, "did you resist temptation", and if they did, they asked, "how did you do it". If they failed at resisting temptation, they asked, "so what did you do to repent afterwards". This showing that they kept themselves accountable for their actions. Therefore, as an example given, keep short accounts with God in this manner and you will likely not fall into terrible sin or chastisement from God.

                        <p>
                        This is why I have put this site here, so that people will not have to struggle quite so much in order to find truths that take many years of watching video content, hearing sermons, and more. I found there is mostly next to no help in many churches or online with a gathered group of information to keep a person or church or family on the correct path as to not fall into traps of evil in many ways and sorts. Either false teachers, false religions, false Christian "prosperity" health and wealth doctrines, false bible translations and more. We also should not continue in worldly things as I have done. I try as all christians do, to avoid sin whilst trapped in a corrupted human body until I die and receive a new un-corrupted one forever.

Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, <span class="small-superscript">(10)</span> "Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <span class="small-superscript">(11)</span> And such <span class="boldSpan">were</span> some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."</span> (1 Corinthians 6:9-11).<span class="italicSpan"> "And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are <span class="boldSpan">sealed</span> unto the day of redemption."</span> (Ephesians 4:30).

						If believer's are sealed until the day of redemption this means a person cannot "out-sin" the forgiving power of the blood of Jesus Christ and our salvation from the torments of the eternal punishment, in the "lake of fire" mentioned in the book of Revelation in the bible (correct?). But, there is "chastisement" for those who go on sinning in a wicked life who are saved. If there is not, then you were not saved, right?

						"<span class="small-superscript">(5)</span> And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: <span class="small-superscript">(6)</span> For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.<span class="small-superscript">(7)</span>) If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
						<span class="small-superscript">(8)</span> But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons."</span> (Hebrews 12:5-8)

							Ultimately, godly detachment from the world is all there is, combined with service for God. Everthing esle is vanity and desire, lusting and addiction. Give it up. It's all worthless decaying garbage. Nothing has any value in this world. So just stop "wanting more". Even after you have learned the truth about all this site and all the content, you will have to give up the desires to keep watching more and more content; the desire to do. The only thing you should do, is something biblically supported or directed by God, or the church, if they are operating biblically of course. And do not let a dead church kill what little Christian effort, heart, will you have. This can happen in some churches where nothing much is discussed or engaged with or fellowshipped in. Can you help a church to be more biblical or more productive without "overly interfereing" or causing problems or divisions. What can you do to help. If nothing because the church is not listening, or is busy or other, what else can or should you be doing without becoming addicted to "doing and being busy". Should you work on yourself first, alone, or study more, or go to church more regularly? What can you do? Ask God and pray about these things. But also the bible tells you to do actions also.

							I would have liked to have had a small book about a quarter the size at most, of the New Testament size, to cover all the essentials of Christian life and lessons to know about life that help a person more than the guidance of the bible itself did for me. Because the bible took too long for me to "figure things out on my own". Such as study methods (avoid memeory palaces though), eating and fasting, ageing issues, childrens education, self-education, overcoming addictions, facts and archaeology of the bible and world history, covered up history, and much more. But this site is limited for internet speed of browser usage and also I am not an author with a publisher or similar. I have next to no money to do such things and others have better resources on websites and from media content; some of which is on this site. I did the best I could think of but am only a weak, relatively poor, relatively mentally and emotionally as well as educationally poor person. You will all have to work it out with God. I wanted to do so much more but the "help" seems to never come.

							Maybe someone one day will make an appropriate gospel Tract a bit smaller than credit-card size for wallets, with adequate detail and resources for a new believer. And, maybe a better more professionally laid out website with downloadable tracts and also content like a small book on all the essentials of life for young and old covering all deceptions and information for Christians too. But, that's up to God. I suppose we never get what we really "want". It would be nice to have someone else do some of the work the church should have done 1000+ years ago rather than waiting for youtube / rumble / websites. It seems too slow and too much work for a relatively poor individual. But no-one seems to have understanding of what is needed. Nevermind, i'll do what I can.

							My last advice is, do not become a worried panic filled fearsome person trying to force yourself to do "good works" out of fear that you do not have any "christian fruits". This is "works based salvation fear". Not "Grace Based Salvation Through Faith in Jesus". Rest in knowing that when you are a Christian, you are "sealed unto the day of redemption". You ARE saved. You are not "being saved". If you could ever out-sin or not keep, or lose salvation, how much sin does it take? How often? Can you get is back? This is the fear many "works based salvation" religions have. They never KNOW they are saved. But we can know (John 5:13), (Romans 8:16). I pray to God the Father that everyone will be saved from Hell and the "lake of fire", forever, in Jesus name I ask and give thanks and Glory to God JHWH, the "I am", Amen. Jesus has already won. But keep preaching the Gospel message to all, so more can be saved from "eternal punishment".

							It does not matter if people who do evil things are simply ignorant and unlearned, or willingly and knowingly working against the people of the world. Sin is the cause of all suffering of people's and nations. It is the cause of collapsed empire's and the reason society is so broken. People do what they think is best in their own minds and not what is actually best in God's will. We are to love our enemies, and everyone else. But, although some evil demonic satanic forces may work in the shadows spiritually affecting persons minds and wills, we still have to bless those who persecute and abuse us as Christians. We are expected to do our part by fleeing fornication, and running from the enemy if we have an option; rather than to fight and kill other's who would harm us. Worldly things are not the concern of a Christian, only the Godly wellbeing and Savation of all. So do not hate the enemy and do not worry for your life or what man can do to you. God is the judge and will judge all that the wicked have done according to their deeds. Simply save people and be as Godly as you can be. This is our duty. And, not in isolation in a cave or a mountain. Otherwise how can you save anyone if you are meant to.
							<br>
							<br>
							No one really knows for sure what is really happening in the world but the signs of the end are everywhere. We all die some day so what does it matter, right? What can we do except pray, help other's, do good, work hard, do and have healthy habits, keep an eye on deceptions / corruptions and to rebuke and call out evil things, activities and persons in the world. Just try to focus on saving other's without panicking and simply live a Christian life not allowing evil to make our minds become full of fear and worry. "Washing" our minds with the word of God, removing all other bad habits and influences, looks to be the correct path of effort to be a more dutyful Christian. But WE, do nothing, all is the power of God. And all Glory belongs to God. For all our works are as filthy rags (see - Isaiah 64:6).
